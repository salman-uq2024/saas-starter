# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the evolution of the SaaS Starter project, highlighting key milestones achieved, current status, and planned enhancements. It demonstrates a mature, production-ready foundation suitable for portfolios, MVPs, or extensions.

## Project Evolution and Milestones

The SaaS Starter began as a minimal Next.js template and has grown into a comprehensive full-stack application with authentication, multi-tenancy, billing, and testing. Key phases:

### Phase 1: Core Setup (Completed)
- **Next.js 14 App Router Integration**: Structured routing for marketing, auth, and app sections with server components for performance.
- **Prisma ORM Setup**: SQLite for dev, Postgres-ready schema with relations for users, workspaces, members, and invites.
- **Environment Hardening**: Zod-validated env vars in [`src/lib/env.ts`](../../../src/lib/env.ts) to prevent misconfigurations.

### Phase 2: Authentication and User Management (Completed)
- **NextAuth.js Implementation**: Magic link emails, demo credentials, and session management with Prisma adapter.
- **Profile Personalization**: Timezone storage and default workspace assignment on sign-up.
- **Security Foundations**: Rate limiting ([`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`](../../../src/lib/rate-limit.ts)) and secure mailer ([`src/server/mailer.ts`](../../../src/server/mailer.ts)).

Milestone: Users can sign in, manage profiles, and access personalized dashboards without external services for local demos.

### Phase 3: Multi-Tenancy and Collaboration (Completed)
- **Workspace System**: Creation, switching, and role-based access (Owner, Admin, Member) via Prisma relations.
- **Invite Workflows**: Token-based invites with status tracking (Pending, Accepted) and email integration.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui-based forms and navigation for seamless team management.

Milestone: Seeded demo data enables instant exploration of team features.

### Phase 4: Billing and Monetization (Completed)
- **Stripe Integration**: Checkout, customer portal, and webhook handling for subscriptions (Free/Pro plans).
- **Stub Mode**: Fallback for demos without keys; real sync in production.
- **Billing UI**: Status badges and upgrade flows in settings.

Milestone: End-to-end billing simulation, with webhooks updating database status.

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality (Completed)
- **Vitest Unit Tests**: Coverage for utilities, actions, and billing logic.
- **Playwright E2E**: Smoke tests for marketing and auth flows.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for lint, typecheck, test, and build.

Milestone: 100% pass rate on checks; packaging script for ZIP distribution.

## Current Status

- **Health**: All core features operational; lint/build/test pass. Deployable to Vercel in minutes.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for install, deploy, features, architecture, security, and ops.
- **Scalability**: Serverless-ready; multi-tenant design supports growth.
- **Risks Mitigated**: No migrations checked in yet (generate baseline); test coverage focused on critical paths.

The project is portfolio-ready: Clean code, secure by default, and extensible.

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

To evolve into a full SaaS platform:

1. **Advanced Testing**: Expand E2E coverage to dashboard, billing success paths, and invite acceptance. Add integration tests for Stripe webhooks.
2. **Database Migrations**: Generate and commit Prisma migrations for schema evolution; support sharding for large tenants.
3. **Service Mocks**: Deterministic stubs for Stripe and email in CI to reduce external dependencies.
4. **Observability**: Integrate Sentry for error tracking and Prometheus for metrics.
5. **Features**: Add file uploads, API rate limiting per workspace, and admin dashboard for super-users.
6. **Compliance**: GDPR tools (data export/deletion), SOC2-aligned audit logs.

These plans prioritize reliability and user experience. Track progress via GitHub issues.
