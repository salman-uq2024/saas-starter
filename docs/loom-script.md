> Goal: demonstrate the marketing site, auth flow, workspace management, and billing stub in under two minutes.

1. **Hook (0:00 – 0:15)**
   - “This is the SaaS Starter – everything you need to launch a production-grade SaaS in a weekend.”
   - Scroll the hero, highlight the CTA and sections (features, security, pricing).

2. **Auth & dashboard (0:15 – 0:45)**
   - Click “Start the demo”, enter `founder@example.com`, mention magic links log to the terminal.
   - Switch to inbox/log (or describe the console link), then land on the dashboard.
   - Call out metrics cards, invite list, and audit trail.

3. **Workspace management (0:45 – 1:15)**
   - Open `Settings → Workspaces`, show the seeded workspace tiles.
   - Jump into a workspace detail page, point out invite form and pending invites.
   - Mention rate limiting + audit logging for every change.

4. **Billing (1:15 – 1:40)**
   - Navigate to `Settings → Billing`, highlight current plan + status badge.
   - Click “Upgrade to Pro” – explain live mode uses Stripe Checkout, stub mode upgrades instantly for demos.

5. **Docs & packaging (1:40 – 2:00)**
   - Open `README` or `docs/` in the repo, point to install/deploy notes.
   - Mention `npm run package` producing a versioned ZIP + SHA256 for client handoff.
   - Close with “Clone, seed, and you’re ready to demo in minutes.”
